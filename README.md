# ERC20 Spot the Bug Challenges by [RareSkills](https://www.rareskills.io)


A collection of intentionally vulnerable ERC-20 smart contracts designed to help developers learn and practice identifying common security bugs in Solidity.

## About This Repository

This repository contains 20 ERC-20 token implementations, each with a unique security vulnerability. The goal is to analyze each contract, identify the bug, and propose a fix. This is an excellent resource for:

- Understanding common ERC-20 vulnerabilities
- Practicing bug identification skills
